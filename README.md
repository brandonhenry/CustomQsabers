# Custom Quest Sabers
Repo to hold all custom 3D model sabers for the Quest version of BeatSaber. Meant to be used with Qosmetics.

## Welcome

Welcome to my repository for all of my custom sabers. I accept requests via discord handle Yuuki#0802. A little background on myself, I have dabbled in 3d modeling and game creation on and off for the past 12 years! That being said, I am no expert modeler and only do it for fun when I feel like being a little more creative than logical. I tend to go around the Quest/BeatSaber/Discord community as Yuuki. Modeling is one of the many passions I have surrounding technology along with helping others! BeatSaber is my favorite Quest game, so it only makes sense miss my passions and likes.

## Donations

I accept donations via my (slightly outdated now) [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/join/yuukisaves) and [KoFi](https://ko-fi.com/supportyuuki) links. 

## Sabers

You can find all of the sabers I have created via my Patreon and KoFi links, or via my Custom Quest Saber Github page. You can also find sabers via my [SideQuest profile]().

Here is a list of current sabers available as well as their status when using with the new version of BeatSaber and Qosmetics:


## Updates

I plan to keep all of my sabers as up to date as possible. I will also keep the list of sabers as well as their recent versions updated as much as possible.
